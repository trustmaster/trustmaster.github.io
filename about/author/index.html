<h1 id="about-the-author">About the author</h1>

<p><img src="http://blog.kodigy.com/img/photo_together.jpg" alt="Photo with wife" /></p>

<p>Hello world! My name is Vladimir and I&rsquo;m a software engineer with a Master degree in Computer Science and background in Content Management Systems.</p>

<h2 id="relevant-topics">Relevant topics</h2>

<p>My most recent experience covers these topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building and maintaining backends with Node.js and NoFlo</li>
<li>Practical use of Flow-based Programming in software architecture and implementation in Go and JavaScript</li>
<li>Technical leadership in small teams and keeping agile projects on full sail</li>
<li>Full-stack web application engineering (earlier with PHP/Laravel and AngularJS, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I started to program back in 2001 and was captivated by the process of creating something out of thin air. Nowadays I still find this exact feeling the most precious about programming, except for solving real people needs of course.</p>

<p>My initial coding experience was highly inspired by DemoScene and included programing graphics, but in 2002 I released a CGI web programming library for FreePascal as my first Open Source project and built a small community around it.</p>

<p>In 2003 I switched to Linux/Apache/PHP/MySQL stack and continued with it as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript for more than a decade.</p>

<p>My amusements at the University (from 2005 to 2011) consisted of many things including C/C++, C#, Prolog, Go, UML, hardware design, machine learning and what not. But the most affecting was FPGA hardware design put together with Systems Analysis models and applied to software engineering - this is what my Master Thesis was about.</p>

<p>Open Source has always played a big role in my life and in 2007 I joined <a href="https://www.cotonti.com/">Cotonti</a> Content Management system and framework to lead its development and support the community.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I continued to earn money as a freelance LAMP specialist and around 2008 gathered a team of like-minded people to found my own development agency called <a href="http://kodigy.com/">Kodigy</a>. Sometimes things at the agency went well, sometimes they didn&rsquo;t. By 2013 I realized that I lack knowledge and skill in acquainting bigger customers and selling my work, and changed for a full-time technical position in Advertisement and Digital Production business.</p>

<p>I grew from a freelance contractor to a CTO in digital production industry, but then I realized that while I was mostly busy making the company run and grow smoothly, my technical expertise was becoming irrelevant. Something I thought too early to happen at the age of 25. So I left the advertisement market and went for a product company.</p>

<p>This is how I joined <a href="https://thegrid.io">The Grid</a> - a pioneer in AI-designed websites. For me it has been a rare opportunity to run Flow-based systems in production and be a part of bright international team.</p>

<h2 id="offtopic">Offtopic</h2>

<p>Besides the scenes, I&rsquo;m a family guy who loves his wife (she&rsquo;s on the photo above) and little daughter.</p>

<p>I enjoy cooking, good food and good music. In winter my sport is skiing, in summer it&rsquo;s fun to ride a bicycle. Below there&rsquo;s a photo of my daughter looking to be not so pleased with it, but in fact she likes riding as much as I do :-)</p>

<p>All cover photos on this website are also by my own, including the shot of my lovely cat on the cover of this page =(^.^)=</p>
